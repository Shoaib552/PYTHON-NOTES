A lambda function is a short function written in one line for quick use.

Normal function:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b


Same thing using lambda:

add = lambda a, b: a + b


Here:

a, b → inputs

: → “now do this”

a + b → result

2. Meaning of : in lambda

Syntax:

lambda arguments: expression


The : means:

“Take these inputs and return this expression”

Example:

square = lambda x: x * x


This means:

take x

return x * x

3. Why lambda is used

Lambda is mainly used when:

The function is very small

You need it only once

You want cleaner and shorter code

4. Common real-life usage examples
Example 1: With map()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
print(result)


Output:

[2, 4, 6, 8]

Example 2: With filter()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)


Output:

[2, 4, 6]

Example 3: With sorted()
students = [("Ali", 80), ("Sara", 95), ("Aman", 70)]

sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(sorted_students)


Sorts by marks.

5. When NOT to use lambda

Do not use lambda when:

Logic is complex

Multiple lines are needed

Readability becomes poor

Bad use:

lambda x: x*x + x/2 - x**3


Better:

def calculate(x):
    return x*x + x/2 - x**3

6. One-line summary

Lambda is used to write small, quick, one-line functions, and : separates inputs from the expression.
