Below is a clear explanation of Python data structures with real-world examples, explained in simple interview-friendly language.

1. List
What it is

A list is an ordered, mutable collection that can store multiple values.

Python example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

Real-world example

Shopping cart in an e-commerce app

Items can be added

Items can be removed

Order matters

cart = ["shirt", "jeans", "shoes"]

When to use

When order matters

When data changes frequently

2. Tuple
What it is

A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection.

Python example
coordinates = (28.61, 77.23)

Real-world example

GPS coordinates

Latitude and longitude never change

location = (12.9716, 77.5946)

When to use

When data should not change

For fixed records

3. Set
What it is

A set is an unordered collection of unique values.

Python example
colors = {"red", "blue", "green"}

Real-world example

Unique visitors to a website

No duplicate user IDs allowed

visitors = {"user1", "user2", "user3"}

When to use

To remove duplicates

Membership checking

4. Dictionary
What it is

A dictionary stores data as key-value pairs.

Python example
student = {"name": "Shoaib", "age": 23}

Real-world example

User profile

user = {
    "username": "shoaib552",
    "email": "shoaib@gmail.com",
    "is_active": True
}

When to use

Fast lookup

Structured data

5. Stack (Using List)
What it is

Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).

Python example
stack = []
stack.append("page1")
stack.append("page2")
stack.pop()

Real-world example

Browser back button

Last visited page opens first

6. Queue (Using collections.deque)
What it is

Follows FIFO (First In, First Out).

Python example
from collections import deque

queue = deque()
queue.append("order1")
queue.append("order2")
queue.popleft()

Real-world example

Customer service queue

First customer served first

7. Linked List (Conceptual)
What it is

Each element points to the next element.

Real-world example

Music playlist

Each song points to the next song

When to use

Frequent insertions/deletions

8. Tree
What it is

Hierarchical data structure.

Real-world example

File system

Root
 ├── Documents
 ├── Pictures
 └── Videos

When to use

Hierarchical relationships

9. Graph
What it is

Nodes connected by edges.

Real-world example

Social media network

Users = nodes

Friends = edges

10. Heap (Priority Queue)
What it is

Special tree where highest or lowest priority comes first.

Python example
import heapq

tasks = []
heapq.heappush(tasks, (1, "urgent"))
heapq.heappush(tasks, (5, "low priority"))

Real-world example

Task scheduler

Urgent tasks executed first

Python data structures help organize data efficiently based on use cases like order, uniqueness, speed, and relationships.
